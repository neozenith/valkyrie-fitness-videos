# DIRECTORIAL & CHARACTER BIBLE

## Character Descriptions

* **Nesta Archeron:** A tall, slender woman with a regal, intimidating presence. Golden-brown hair, piercing grey-blue eyes. Her personality is cold, prickly, and proud, with a sharp tongue. Beneath this, she is fiercely loyal, resilient, and on a difficult healing journey. Her movements should be precise, controlled, and powerful.
* **Cassian:** A tall, broad-shouldered, and heavily muscled Illyrian warrior. Tan skin, shoulder-length black hair, warm hazel eyes, and large, bat-like wings. His personality is charming, cocky, and humorous, but he is also a brave and respected general with a good heart. His movements should be explosive and confident.

## Setting & Atmosphere

An ancient, open-air Illyrian training ring. Key elements include worn stone floors, distant misty mountain peaks, and racks of weapons blurred in the background. The atmosphere is elemental, intense, and charged with energy.

## The 5-Video Narrative Arc (40-Second Workout Block)

Each markdown prompt you generate must be for ONE of the following 8-second video segments.

* **Video 1: The Challenge & The Standard:** The Leader introduces the standard exercise with confidence. The Banterer (off to the side) delivers a sharp, witty critique of their form or arrogance.
* **Video 2: The Concession & The Regression:** The Banterer becomes the new Leader. They demonstrate a simpler version (the regression), framing it as the "smarter" or "more precise" option. They break the fourth wall to offer this tip directly to the user.
* **Video 3: The Escalation & The Boast:** The original Leader, provoked, reclaims the spotlight. They demonstrate a harder, more explosive version (the progression) to show off. Their dialogue is a direct boast or challenge.
* **Video 4: The Silent Duel & The Slapstick Sabotage:** No dialogue. Both characters perform the standard exercise side-by-side. The focus is on intense, competitive effort, but with a moment of playful sabotage (e.g., one tries to trip the other, who responds with a wing-smack, followed by a cheeky smile).
* **Video 5: The Final Push & The Unified Goal:** Their personal competition dissolves. They are both fatigued but focused on a shared goal. One of them looks directly at the camera and delivers a breathless, commanding line of encouragement to the user to finish the set strong.
